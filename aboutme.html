            <p class="fs-5 text-start fw-medium lh-lg">I am a 12 years old boy who started my programming journy in 2021. <br>
                My first experience with programming was in Roblox Studio, which is a game engin used to develop roblox
                games. One of the most mentionable game was called Million Robox. this game was a kind of obby but with
                a
                big challeng that was "If you Beat this Obby I will give you 50 robox" (The word robux refers to the
                money
                in roblox that we use to by gamepasses with)and that was kind of true... However I made the last part
                impossible to beat so no one can get the money and that one gsme had more than 1300 visits and I recieed
                masseg from roblox telling me that whoever plays my game and enjoys it I will get 10 robox and i was so
                Happy to see that but unfortinately the game had an error that I couldn't solve that made the game
                unplayable and I didn't get any robux at the end. But that motivation and the masseg itself had me
                thinking
                of what could happen if I was a Big developer and lots of people played my games</p>
